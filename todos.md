# TODOs...

- Get opacity of that background range line (when it hasn't been passed through by an event) the same as the container opacity
- Adjust so you can have different radiuses of marker and they are positioned correctly
- organize css and js in one place (ciphon it off from rest of code in leaflet controller function for better readability)
- make better example data (lats and lons)
- create multiple example formats or button that lets you switch between some formatting examples in index.html
